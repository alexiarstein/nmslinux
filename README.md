#No Man's Sky Editor For Linux (Portable)

##Description:

This is a portable port (heh) for GoatFungus' No Man's Sky Save Editor for Linux Users

It does not require Java to be installed in order to run thus it can be ran

In SteamDeck or just about any other Linux Operating System.


##USE:

run ./nms


2. Locate your savegame 
-> /compatdata/275850/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/HelloGames/NMS/st_76561197977959033/

(Note that the numbers following st_* probably differ, but that's the directory you want. 
It would also be convenient to create a symlink to this directory somewhere of easy access such as your homedir)



##CREDITS:

The main work (almost all the work, to be honest) is done by goatfungus https://github.com/goatfungus

I merely have made it a bit easier for Linux Players.

I will update the jar file whenever he updates it. Please let me know if the jar file is outdated.
